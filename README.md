# My personal (Neo)Vim config
Love it or hate it but this is my personal neovim config. This is tailor made to me so if you're looking for a fully featured vim config where everything is done for you, try SpaceVim.

## Install
### Install the latest NVIM

This config requires neo nightly.

As of writing this, it's only availbale from the github releases page or the unstable PPA
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install neovim
```

### Run Make
To install to nvim run
```
make install-nvim
```

This commands will remove any old config

## Dependencies
These dependencies are for ubuntu based systems as this is what i primarily use

```
build-essential
git
gh
curl
php
nodejs
ripgrep
```
