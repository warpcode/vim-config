# My personal Vim config
Love it or hate it but this is my personal vim config. This is tailor made to me so if you're looking for a fully featured vim config where everything is done for you, try SpaceVim.

## Install
### NVIM
To install with nvim, symlink .vimrc to ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

### VIM
To install with vim, symlink .vimrc to ~/.vimrc

### Updating
On the first load, if vim-plug is not installed, the script will auto install it provided curl is installed.
To update use one of the following depending on whether you are using vim or nvim

`nvim +PlugInstall +qall`

or

`vim +PlugInstall +qall`
